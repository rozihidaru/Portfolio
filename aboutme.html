<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>     Hello! My name is Rozi Hidaru, and I'm a rising senior at Lakeside School in Seattle, Washington. I play basketball and I run cross-country and track. 
  I am also the president of Lakeside's Black Student Union, and I am a member of the Student Health Advocacy Committee and the Student Affinity Leadership Team.
  In my free time I like to read, spend time with my three younger siblings, and watch TV. A fun fact about me is that although I love to travel, I've only been on a plane three times. I have also never broken a bone.
  This summer I'm participating in a Girls Who Code internship at Amazon. I'm very interested in computer science, and through this internship I've been learning even more about programming, like how to make this website.
  I hope to continue learning about computer science and possibly continue to make it my career!

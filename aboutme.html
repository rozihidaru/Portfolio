<h1>Rozi Hidaru: About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Rozi Hidaru. I'm a rising senior at Lakeside School in Seattle, Washington. I play basketball and I run cross-country and track. 
  I am also the president of Lakeside's Black Student Union, and I am a member of the Student Health Advocacy Committee and the Student Affinity Leadership Team.
  In my free time I like to read, spend time with my three younger siblings, and watch TV.

<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>     Hello! My name is Rozi Hidaru, and I'm a rising senior at Lakeside School in Seattle, Washington. I play basketball and I run cross-country and track. 
  I am also the president of Lakeside's Black Student Union, and I am a member of the Student Health Advocacy Committee and the Student Affinity Leadership Team.
  In my free time I like to read, spend time with my three younger siblings, and watch TV. A fun fact about me is that although I love to travel, I've only been on a plane three times. I have also never broken a bone.
  This summer I'm participating in a Girls Who Code internship at Amazon. I'm very interested in computer science, and through this internship I've been learning even more about programming, like how to make this website.
  I hope to continue learning about computer science and possibly continue to make it my career!

One of my first projects in Scratch was a side scroller game. My partner and I made a game called Flying Food, in which the player has to avoid the salad (-20 points) and try to eat the tacos (+10 points).
The game ends when the player gets 100 points (they win) or -100 points (they lose).

<p>Reflection on Robots:</p>
<p id="robots" style="display:none">What I thought was the most interesting and eye-opening part of the day for me was when we tried to come up for a definition of robots as a class. There was a lot of disagreement, and this really made me think about and question how I define robots. 
 When we learned about newly invented robots, it made me excited about the future because there will be so many new, advanced robots that will hopefully change the lives of humans for the better. With working on circuits, I think it's necessary to keep trying new ideas when what is currently being done doesn't work. 
 Our group did this well, and through trial and error, we were able to create a working circuit because we did not give up.

Reflection on Robot Song and Dance:
<p id="song" style="display:none">In this project, I learned about more aspects of circuits, like how to use Servo on the Board of Education shield. My favorite part about this project was the song because it was fun to code the notes, 
but we had some trouble with getting our robot to dance the way we wanted it to. Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need movement outputs for their robots because the robots need to sense their surroundings.

<h2>The Core 4 of Coding</h2>
<p>
Conditionals: A conditional runs code if a certain requirement is met. If (something): do x. Else: do y. 
A real-life example would be that if you get an A on your test, your parents will let you hang out with your friends. If not, you have to stay home and study.

<br>
<br>
Variables: A variable stores information. Variables can be booleans (True/False), integers (numbers), or strings (text). It's just like variables in a math class, like y=8 and x=3.

<br>
Functions: A function defines code so it is easier and less complicated for the coder to use.

Loops: A loop repeats a part of code as many times as indicated by the coder.
